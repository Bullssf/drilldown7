These are some of the things Drilldown does for you automatically:

#94 - automatically trim any string values so that if you change some of values but not others (as in the case of 'SecureScript ' with a space), it will consider them the same.
You can have a refiner (group) that is a multi-select value including choice or even lookup value.

#107 - Special link column features:
For Refiners or View columns, add /GetLinkUrl and /GetLinkDesc to Link columns to use either the Url or the Description of the link as a value

Example:
ColumnInternalName/GetLinkUrl
ColumnInternalName/GetLinkDesc

Example of IViewField:
  {
    "name": "ColumnInternalName/GetLinkDesc",
    "displayName": "What ever you want",
    "minWidth": 200,
    "linkPropertyName": "ColumnInternalName/GetLinkUrl"
  },
